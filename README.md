### *This webpage is not mobile responsive*
### *Developed from desktop design*


## NavBar
I decided to make it sticky so it would follow the screen down, enabling the user easy access to page control.

## Home page
For the read more function, I used a section element, that could toggle on and off. It would only show when the read more button was pressed which prevented the extra text from leaking into the section1 page.

## Section 1
After some experimenting I settled on https://flickity.metafizzy.co/ for the carousel. I think it works well and will definitely use it in future projects.

## Section 2
I used https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp as a base and reference to creating the slide show function.

## Footer
With the footer I just had to make sure the relevant elements were grouped together correctly to enable easy styling to the design.


*I enjoyed making this webpage, thanks for the challenge,*
